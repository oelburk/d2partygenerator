# Diablo 2 Party Generator

*Hail to you champion...*

This is a simple Diablo 2 party generator for those times when you can't decide who's going to play the necro. I know it's a bit messy atm but feel free to add issues/feature requests.

I won't mind if you build upon my code. Just let me know where and how so can stop by and say hello!

## Nitty Gritty

This project is written in Dart using Flutter and compiled as a simple web application. This is the product of something that started as an idea -> code -> somewhat finished application over the course of just a day, more or less.

And yes, there will be bugs. But also love ♥️
